Functional interface can have default and static methods.

Runnable  - public abstract void run(); - SAM
Callable - sinnce jdk1.5
Comparable - since jdk1.2
Function<Object,Object> - it takes single input and return single output. it has apply,andThen method.
BiFunction - - it takes two input and return single output. it has apply method.
Consumer - is a buildt in functional interface. it accepts one input param and it returns nothing and just consumes the param, it is having accept, andThen methods.
BiConsumer - is a buildt in functional interface.  it accepts two input params. it returns nothing, it is having accept, andThen methods.
Predicate - is a buildt in functional interface.It accepts one param . it always boolean that is returns either true/false, is is having test() and default and static methods.
BiPredicate - It accepts two param .
UnaryOperator -
BinaryOperator -
Supplier - it will not take any input data and return some data.
